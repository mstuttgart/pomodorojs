## About

PomodoroJS is minimal and easy to use Pomodoro Timer to help you manage time and complete your tasks. 

### What is **Pomodoro**?

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a Pomodoro
> ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

### How to Use

The original technique has six steps

* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
* Work on the task.
* End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5–10 minutes)
* If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
* After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, repeat Pomodoro again.
